## 1. Data Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes student engagement by leveraging data related to student demographics, enrollment patterns, and attendance records. The dataset comprises key attributes, including:

* Student ID (Unique identifier for each student)
* Name (Anonymized or actual student names)
* Age (Demographic categorization)
* Gender (Diversity and inclusion analysis)
* Course Name (Academic program classification)
* Enrollment Date (Timeline for student registration)
* Attendance (Participation and engagement tracking)

The primary objective is to derive data-driven insights by calculating critical metrics such as:

* Retention Rate – Assessing student persistence over time
* Average Attendance Trends – Identifying participation patterns
* Enrollment Growth & Distribution – Analyzing trends across courses
* Course Satisfaction Rate – Measuring student feedback & engagement

Through advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, this project aims to provide actionable insights that support informed decision-making to enhance student engagement and academic success.

## 2. Data Cleaning

* Implemented robust data preprocessing techniques by imputing missing values with appropriate statistical methods and eliminating incomplete records in critical fields such as Age, Gender, Attendance Percentage, Retention Status, and Satisfaction Score, ensuring data integrity.

* Performed comprehensive data validation by standardizing date formats for enrollment records and applying logical constraints to attendance values to maintain data accuracy and consistency.

* Optimized dataset structure by standardizing column names, enforcing uniform formatting conventions, and enhancing schema consistency for seamless data integration and analysis.

* Executed advanced data cleansing strategies by identifying and removing duplicate entries and leveraging statistical methods to detect and eliminate outliers, thereby improving overall data quality and reliability.
